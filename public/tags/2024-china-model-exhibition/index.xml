      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the annual China Model Exhibition again, which is being held at the Beijing Exhibition Hall. I arrived on the evening of April 18 and started reporting on the exhibition on Friday, April 19. There are many more people this year than last year when the epidemic just ended. There are also more foreigners than last year, many of whom are agents and buyers. At the fms booth, airplanes and cars were placed together.</description>

It's the annual China Model Exhibition again, which is being held at the Beijing Exhibition Hall. I arrived on the evening of April 18 and started reporting on the exhibition on Friday, April 19. There are many more people this year than last year when the epidemic just ended. There are also more foreigners than last year, many of whom are agents and buyers.

#### HoWing
The most eye-catching model at the HoWing booth is the Axe R3. It has a 130A ESC and is paired with a 4274 motor, 1700Kv and 2000Kv, both supporting 6S. ​​I will test the effect of installing this motor on a 1/8 KM Ford Raptor and tow a real car to see how it performs.

It looks great, right?

#### Raytheon KM

The Raytheon KM booth brought a prototype of the Dodge Tyrannosaurus Rex, which is a little longer than the previous Ford Raptor and doesn't look like an 8-inch car. The front bumper is temporarily made with 3D printing, and it will definitely be molded later, and it will be much more delicate. Don't worry about the lighting, Raytheon's products have the coolest lights.
Who can refuse such a pickup truck? You say it's right!

Then there is the 1/8 Tank 300 hard shell version, which will have all doors open, very realistic, and can also use the existing Tank 300 chassis, saving money for upgraders. The only shortcoming of the current prototype is that the trunk space is occupied by the receiver box, so there is no room for more things.

#### The CNHL's battery
The famous violent battery is used by many people who play FPV and extreme speed because it is cost-effective and very powerful. It is not the kind of C with false label, but very strong in actual tests. There are many extreme speed records of over 300km/h.
